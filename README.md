ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Stephie Lopes, an engineering graduate. I have done my engineering in Information Technology from St. Francis Institute of Technology, Mumbai.
When I started my programming journey, I learned some main steps like good understanding of problem, step-by step algorithm designing(pseudo code), writing clean code and optimizing it etc.
